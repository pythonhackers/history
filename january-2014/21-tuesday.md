Development
--------------

- Update discussion page to exclude initial posts from rendering, and let the AJAX cycle take care of the initial pageload.
The problem was that, the last message ID was -1, which was causing the initial AJAX call reload the records. Loading no records at all
seems to suppress the problem for right now, but in the future, we might need to go with another root/solution.
